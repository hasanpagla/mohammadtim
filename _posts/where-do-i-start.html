<p>A lot of people write emails to me with long stories about their ruqyah problems, the history, the people that they have seen, the experiences that they have had, and quite frequently, a plea for help. I made this website with the primary objective of helping the people who write these emails, without them waiting months for me to answer. However, I realise that a lot of people become overwhelmed with their situation, and they want some simple steps. Below is my generic advice that I would offer to almost everyone who writes me an email asking for help:</p>
<ol>
<li>In most people's accounts of what has happened to them, there's a lot of wrong information and a lot of wrong treatment. To get rid of that, we have to start from scratch, and build knowledge step by step. Therefore I'd advise that you start with a blank slate; I'm not saying to forget the past, but put it on the back burner. Don't dwell on the difficulties, and how long it has been. Focus entirely on the following three basic steps:
<ol>
<li>Get knowledge.</li>
<li>Put that knowledge into practice.</li>
<li>Be continuous and patient, slow and steady.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Get your intention right. If you're reading this, and you're a human being (or a <em>jinni</em> for that matter), then you've made some pretty big mistakes. All of us have. Take a few moments to think through those mistakes, recognise them, and then start the road to repentance. Ask Allāh to <a href="http://duas.com/dua/344/dua-to-seek-protection-of-allah-from-committing-shirk">purify your intention</a>, to <a href="http://duas.com/dua/282/dua-for-one-whose-affairs-have-become-difficult">make things easy for you</a>, and <a href="http://duas.com/dua/394/dua-seeking-forgiveness-from-allah">to forgive you</a>. Be committed to learning proper Islamic beliefs and following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh ﷺ in everything that you do.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="/programme">Full Ruqyah Programme</a>, click on every single link, and follow step by step. It's essentially a summary of the action that you're going to need to take, so get familiar with it from day one. Make notes on things that aren't clear to you.</li>
<li>Start with <a href="/7dayrd">The 7 Day Ruqyah Programme</a>, while you are busy learning.</li>
<li>Read and implement the answer to the question <a href="/posts/how-can-i-protect-myself">How Can I Protect Myself?</a>.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="/video">video section</a>. Watch all of the videos, from beginning to end. Keep making notes on things that are unclear, and things that are particularly relevant to you.</li>
<li>Go through <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, as I answer the most common questions that people have there. Most of the outstanding issues in your notes should be answered there; however if you have outstanding questions, it would be a good idea to send me an email, so that I can add the answer to a post that others can benefit from.</li>
<li>The key to ruqyah is patience and consistency. Many people email and saying, &quot;it's not working!&quot; For most of them, the problem is simply a lack of patience, and specifically a lack of consistency. Other common problems include major sins that are not being dealt with, or innovated practices that are being mixed with the ruqyah. If those issues are all being tackled, then I would suggest reading <a href="posts/why-is-my-treatment-taking-so-long">this blog post</a>, for an answer as to why ruqyah treatment can take a long time.</li>
<li>Ruqyah is all about change, and circumstances change rapidly. Be sure to keep coming back to the information, and adapting your programme to deal with the different things that are happening. <a href="/posts/how-do-i-know-that-my-treatment-is-complete">This blog post</a> talks about the changes that happen as treatment is nearing its end, and provides some general advice.</li>
</ol>
<p>May Allāh make it easy for us and for you!</p>
