<p>#Ruqyah Audio</p>
<p>These links were part of the <a href="/ruqyah">ruqyah information</a> page, but have been moved here to make it easy to refer to them in emails and presentations.</p>
<p>Our experience is that the audio in these links can be an effective part of treatment. However, it isn't a replacement for ruqyah, but an additional tool that can be used. We find it best if the audio is listened to using in-ear headphones.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of ruqyah audio available on the internet, but we have found these two to be among the best, and all praise is for Allāh:</p>
