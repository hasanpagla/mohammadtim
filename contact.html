<p><strong>Please read this carefully</strong></p>
<p>For several years, I have been struggling with the volume of emails that I receive each day. I have made several changes in order to make this easier, the latest of which is described <a href="http://muhammadtim.com/posts/solving-the-email-problem">here</a> - however, even with those changes, so many of my most important projects have become delayed - most are several months behind schedule.</p>
<p>In order to reverse this trend, with the help of Allāh, I have made the difficult decision to take a break from responding to emails and messages for the next three months, until the 17th September 2016. During this time, I will be working hard to get the projects related to the <a href="www.humblefoundation.org">Humble Foundation</a>, and <a href="www.muhammadtim.com">my website</a> back on track, in shā’ Allāh.</p>
<p>I will not be storing any emails or messages during this time, so you will not receive a response unless you send it again after the 17th September.</p>
<p>I know that the many of the emails and messages that I receive are urgent in nature. However, if I were to respond to those, I would be back to the same situation as I find myself in now. Therefore, I will not be responding to emails, regardless of how urgent they are. I believe that there is more than enough material on my website to help even the most serious of ruqyah cases, in shā’ Allāh, and so I would direct you to that as a temporary resource.</p>
<p>May Allāh reward you for your understanding and your patience - may Allāh give me the ability to complete my work quickly, so that I can get back to helping as many people as possible.</p>
