<p>#Ruqyah Programme for Patients</p>
<p>All of our ruqyah patients, whether those who have previously attended our ruqyah clinic, or those who are receiving advice <a href="/contact">by email</a>, need to have a strict minimum programme which they follow, either through self-treatment, or with the help of friends and family.</p>
<p>We consider this <strong>the minimum that a person needs to do</strong> in order to deal with the problem they have, whether jinn possession, magic, evil eye, or any other problem for which ruqyah is recommended as a treatment.</p>
<p>We also recommend that patients, or their family and friends keep a record of how much they do each day, as well as changes that happen, in order to better aid the raaqi in advising the best form of treatment.</p>
<p>####Pre-conditions for treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the patient directs all of their worship to Allāh alone, without giving a share of Allah's rights to anyone or anything else; trusting in Allāh completely and recognising that there is no cure except from Allāh.</li>
<li>That the patient is strict in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh صلى الله عليه وسلم to the best of their ability, and turns away from anything which opposes it, including forms of dhikr and protection that were not sanctioned by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or practised by his companions (may Allāh be pleased with them).</li>
<li>That the patient is not in the possession of a ta'weez.</li>
<li>That the patient's house is - to the best of their ability - free of pictures and photographs of animate objects, as well as other things that attract the shaytaan.</li>
<li>That the patient is praying all of the five obligatory prayers every single day, on time, without <em>qadaa</em> (making up the prayers after their time has passed).</li>
<li>That the patient and those people treating them watch the <a href="/video">10 part ruqyah course</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>####The following things must be done daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>The patient must read all of the adhkaar mentioned <a href="/protectys">here</a>, at the times mentioned in the article (they may supplement this with further authentic adhkaar if they wish). This means that they should be reading certain adhkaar (as described in the article) every single morning and every single evening, as well as every single night before going to bed.</li>
<li>The patient must read the Qur'an <strong>at least 45 minutes each day</strong> (ideally twice or three times per day), with the intention of ruqyah. This must comprise of <strong>at least</strong> <a href="http://quran.com/1">al-Faatihah</a>, <a href="http://quran.com/2/255">Aayat-ul-Kursi</a>, <a href="http://quran.com/112">al-Ikhlaas</a>, <a href="http://quran.com/113">al-Falaq</a>, and <a href="http://quran.com/114">an-Naas</a>, repeated to fill the time. If the person is unable to read over themselves, then someone must read over them. If there is no other choice, they can use <a href="/audio">ruqyah audio</a>, or they can use ruqyah audio as a complement to physical recitation.</li>
<li>The patient must repent to Allāh frequently throughout the day, and must be active in making du'aa, including du'aa relating to ruqyah and sickness, as well as the du'aa of <a href="http://duas.com/dua/471/dua-from-the-quran-12">Ayyub</a>, and the du'aa of <a href="http://duas.com/dua/472/dua-from-the-quran-13">Yunus</a>. Learn what they mean, and implement them. The lecture on du'aa <a href="/video">here</a> may also be of help.</li>
</ul>
<p>####The following things must be done weekly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The patient must read <a href="http://quran.com/2">Surah al-Baqarah</a> in their home, <strong>no less than once every three days</strong>. It would be preferrable if al-Baqarah was integrated into the daily ruqyah, and <strong>even better if it can be completed once or twice per day</strong>, but this depends on a person's ability. If a person is unable to read, they may ask someone else to read in their house, and if nobody is available, they may play the recorded audio recitation, such as the example <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3I2jiBUTk">here</a>. However, the recorded audio is not sufficient if there are people who can recite.</li>
</ul>
<p>####The following things must be done monthly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The patient must implement the <a href="/7dayrd">7 day programme</a>, <strong>at least once every month, preferrably twice.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>####The following things should be done regularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The patient should be cupped (cupping in Arabic is called <em>hijaamah</em>) on a regular basis. They should advise the practitioner of their specific problem, and be cupped in the place(s) that are advised by the experts for this problem, as well as the place(s) where they feel the pain is concentrated. In all of this, the recommendations of the cupping practitioner should be followed at all times.</li>
</ul>
