<p>####Question</p>
<p>I've found something that appears to be some kind of ta'weez and perhaps even magic. How can I destroy it?</p>
<p>####Answer</p>
<p>When it comes to destroying ta'weez, there are a number of things to bear in mind. This answer is adapted from the answer given by Shaykh ‘Adil al-Muqbil (may Allāh protect and preserve him), and is similar to the methods taught to the members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in Saudi Arabia who deal with magic on a day-to-day basis. I have added some things myself, including some additional points of safety, and additional descriptions, but the basic method is that of the Shaykh -- Muhammad Tim.</p>
<p><strong>You will need the following equipment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A tray, so that everything stays together, and nothing falls on the floor.</li>
<li>A long neck gas lighter - the kind often used for lighting barbecues.</li>
<li>A suitable container for burning the ta'weez in. I use a stainless steel metal cylinder, but you can use an old pan, or anything that can take the heat.</li>
<li>Gloves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the ta'weez is encased in a container, you will also need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A pair of pliers and scissors, and possibly other tools to open the case.</li>
<li>Eye protection is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the ta'weez contains knots, you will also need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A loose razor blade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the method calls for ruqyah water, you will also need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A bowl of tap water.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;hr /&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Before beginning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend that during the whole process, from beginning to end, the person continually recites <a href="http://quran.com/113">al-Falaq</a> and <a href="http://quran.com/114">an-Naas</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to open the ta'weez:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the ta'weez completely inside of the tray, so that you collect anything that might fall from it.</li>
<li>Open the ta'weez carefully, so that you do not hurt yourself, and so that the ta'weez is not broken up while you are opening it (although this may sometimes happen).</li>
<li>Many ta'weez are encased in metal or leather, often with wax to seal them in. Use pliers, scissors, and other suitable tools to remove the metal or leather casing. Keep all discarded parts on the tray, so that none are lost.</li>
<li>Wax can be removed by melting it gently with the heat from the lighter flame.</li>
<li>Once the ta'weez is opened, it should be inspected for knots. Any knots should be cut through completely using the loose razor blade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the ta'weez is engraved in metal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the ta'weez is writing engraved in metal, such as a ring, then you will need to grind the writing off the metal, using a file or multi-tool, until there are no visible markings.</li>
<li>Once all markings are removed, dispose of by burying in clean earth, in a place which is not frequently used by people, such as the bottom of the garden, or a disused area of land, or by throwing it in the river or sea.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the ta'weez is written on paper:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the ta'weez was given for the purpose of burning (i.e., the magician said that it has to be burned at a certain time), it should be destroyed using the water method.</li>
<li>If the ta'weez is made up of writing in soluble ink (usually yellow, saffron based ink, or pink colour), it should also be destroyed using the water method.</li>
<li>Any other ta'weez should be destroyed using the burning method.</li>
<li>If in doubt, combine the two, by using the water first, then drying the ta'weez and using the burning method.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;hr /&gt;</p>
<p><strong>The burning method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put the ta'weez into a suitable container to burn. This will help to collect all of the ash and residue.</li>
<li>The ta'weez should ideally be burnt in a place which is not frequently used by people, such as the bottom of the garden, or a disused area of land, to reduce the risk of someone being harmed by it.</li>
<li>Using a long neck gas lighter, burn the ta'weez as completely as possible, trying not to inhale the smoke. If you are struggling, you may need to recite over the ta'weez, as you are burning it.</li>
<li>Bury the ash and residue in clean earth, along with the contents of the tray that you used to open the ta'weez on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The water method:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take a bowl of water, and recite <a href="http://quran.com/1">al-Faatihah</a>, and the last three surahs of the Qur'an in it. If you already have <a href="/7dayrd">ruqyah water prepared</a>, you can use that.</li>
<li>Keep the bowl of water on the tray, so that everything is kept together, and the water doesn't spill.</li>
<li>Put the ta'weez into the water, rubbing off any soluble ink.</li>
<li>Take the ta'weez out of the water, break it apart as much as you can, and dispose of the remaining ta'weez and the water in a place which is not frequently used by people, such as the bottom of the garden, or a disused area of land, to reduce the risk of someone being harmed by it, or by throwing it in the river or sea.</li>
</ul>
