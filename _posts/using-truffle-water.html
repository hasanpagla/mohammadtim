<p><strong>THE USUAL DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor and this is not a substitute for medical advice. Do not implement anything of the following without consulting your doctor, or a suitably qualified professional.</strong></p>
<p>From the medicines which are established in the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ is the <a href="http://sunnah.com/urn/179710">use of truffle water</a>. I've done my very best to gather together whatever information that I can find on the usage of truffles, in order to help those who are trying to implement this Sunnah treatment. Notably, some people of knowledge said that the word 'eye' here is general, and covers both ailments of the eye, and significantly, <strong>the evil eye</strong>. There is some empirical data which supports this.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that truffles are expensive. I do not recommend that you use them as an initial treatment, until you have tried the other inexpensive treatments, such as the <a href="/7dayrd">7 day programme</a>, and I do not recommend that you buy in large amounts, until you are sure that the truffle is having the desired effect.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Type of Truffle:</strong> autumn or winter truffle. This is from the experience of those  You only need a very small amount. <a href="http://trufflehunter.co.uk">trufflehunter.co.uk</a> is one place to source it.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>One option is to cut it up into small pieces, put it in a brown paper bag, and leave in the fridge until it goes hard.</li>
<li>The second option is to cut it up into small pieces and put in a jar of olive oil, then freeze. To use, defrost the frozen oil naturally at room temp, take out a piece and then put it back in the freezer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Methods of Use:</strong> There are a few ways to use the truffle, and you can try them all.
<ul>
<li>The first - and the most common - is to chop an odd number of truffles into small pieces and boil it in a little bit of water. Let the water cool, and then use it as an eye drop, or as part of an eye bath. You'll have to experiment with how much water to use, as there isn't a lot of information available, but I would use ZamZam water, and try only to use as little as is needed to get the water out of the truffle. I would try this first, because (a) I've tried it myself and it works, and (b) you can adjust the concentration of the truffle according to how much water you use, so you can test out a little bit of truffle first and see if it helps, as well as making sure that it doesn't cause any irritation.</li>
<li>The second is to mash up the truffle and extract the water that way. I've never tried that myself, but it's mentioned that Abū Hurayrah (may Allāh be pleased with him) used to do it in that way.</li>
<li>Another source mentioned that by heating up the cut up truffle without water, the liquid in the truffle will come out. I haven't tried this either, but it is mentioned in an article on using truffle water.</li>
<li>In all of those cases, you use the water as an eye bath, or an eye drop. However, there is one more way to do it, which is to use the water (I would try this with the pure truffle water, from either the second or third method) and to mix it with ithmid kohl. Kohl is mentioned in the hadeeth as being beneficial for the eye, and the best kind is mentioned in the hadeeth as being ithmid. It's quite easy to find, in shā' Allāh, although you have to make sure that it is genuine, otherwise they mix all sorts of rubbish with it. Mix the two, so that you have a combination of truffle water and ithmid kohl and apply it to the eyes before going to sleep, according to the kohl instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would also recommend the following for those who are seeking to treat the evil eye:
<ul>
<li>Take a very small piece, boil in 1 litre of water for 10 mins. Drink one mint-tea-sized cup (the cups that are just a bit bigger than Arab coffee cups), once or twice per day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all of the information that I have gathered so far. If anyone has anything further to add from their knowledge and experience, please do feel free to <a href="/contact">let me know</a>.</p>
