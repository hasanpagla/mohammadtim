<p>#Simple Things to Protect Yourself from the Shaytaan</p>
<p>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p>Many times during ruqyah, we begin be advising people to remember Allah at specific times during the day and night. Lately, I've observed that giving people all of the <em>du‘aa</em> and <em>dhikr</em> from the Sunnah is often too much, and at times the shayṭaan comes to a person and they become lazy.</p>
<p>During my recent time with our Shaykh ‘Adil ibn Ṭahir al-Muqbil, I noticed that he only recommended a very limited number of things to do for protection in the morning and evening; when leaving the house; and when going to bed. The shaykh was asked about this, and he replied that there are many things that a person can do, but we want to give people something that is both easy and effective.</p>
<p>Based on the advice of the shaykh, and some of my own research and experience, I've compiled a list of simple things that everyone can do to protect themselves. <strong>This list is not intended to be comprehensive - it's intended to be easy for everyone, whilst covering the things that provide the strongest protection, with the permission of Allah.</strong></p>
<p>There is more information in <a href="http://muhammadtim.com/posts/how-can-i-protect-myself">this blog post</a>, to complement this article.</p>
<p>Before beginning, I'd like to remind everyone, that du‘aa and dhikr have etiquettes that must be observed. From the most important is that you are conscious of what you are saying and focused upon the meaning; really take the time out to pause whatever you are doing and sit quietly, remembering your need of Allah, and calling upon him sincerely.
