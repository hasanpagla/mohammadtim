<p>#An Advice Regarding Sickness &amp; Difficulty, Especially in Relation to Magic</p>
<p>This is a long piece which I wrote to one of my first ruqyah patients. I think it is - by the grace of Allāh - beneficial for any person experiencing hardship or difficulty in their lives, especially due to sickness, and even more so when that sickness is caused by the jinn, magic &amp; the evil eye.</p>
<p>I've broken it down into a number of sections (they're supposed to be read in order):</p>
