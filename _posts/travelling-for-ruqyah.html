<p>####Question</p>
<p>I would like to travel to see you, or another ruqyah practitioner, for the purpose of ruqyah. What do you advise?</p>
<p>####Answer</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the number of people seeking ruqyah has reached epidemic proportions. This is true for every practitioner who is doing their best to help others according to the Book of Allāh, and the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ. Allowing people to travel for the purpose of ruqyah is only making the problem worse, in a number of ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the point of view of reliance upon Allāh, it is problematic that a person would travel for hundreds of miles for the sake of seeking ruqyah.</li>
<li>From the point of view of money, it is wasteful.</li>
<li>From the point of view of the rights of the local patients, it is infringing upon their rights, and burdening the ruqyah practitioner with a burden that is hard to bear.</li>
<li>Most ruqyah cases are long-term, and require a significant investment of time, which a travelling person simply cannot commit to.</li>
<li>It leads to copycatting and exaggeration, with hundreds of other people who want to do the same, and people saying, &quot;Travel to so-and-so, he has the best ruqyah!&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>For this reason, I would not consider treating a patient who is travelling from outside of the local area, unless the following conditions were present:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the person has extensively tried self-ruqyah, and has been guided through the process, such as strictly following the article <a href="/posts/where-do-i-start">Where Do I Start?</a>, followed by <a href="/contact">email support</a>, and so on.</li>
<li>That the person is following all of the guidelines and conditions of ruqyah to the best of their ability.</li>
<li>That the person has a genuinely serious case, which either puts their religion at considerable risk, or has caused them to suffer a significant loss in quality of life.</li>
<li>That the person has no other family member, friend, or ruqyah practitioner who could help them.</li>
<li>That it is believed that by travelling, and after the help of Allāh, they would benefit.</li>
</ol>
